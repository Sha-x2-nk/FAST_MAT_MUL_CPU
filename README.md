RAM RAM

### BELOW ARE RESULTS SUMMARISED
| KERNEL | RUNTIME | relative speedup | absolute speedup
|--------|---------|--| -- |
| LVL1. NAIVE MATMUL| 928 seconds | 1 | 1 |
| LVL2. CACHE AWARE LOOP REARRANGEMENT | 113 seconds | 8.2x | 8.2x |
| LVL3. COMPILER CHANGE TO ICPX & -O3 | 13.623 seconds | 8.29x | 68.12x |
| LVL4. PARALLEL FOR LOOP USING TBB | 2.285 seconds | 5.96x | 406.1x |
| LVL5. TILING | 1.583 seconds | 1.443x | 586.2x |
| LVL6. PARALLEL RECURSION | 1.293 seconds | 1.2x | 717.7x |
| LVL7. COMPILER FLAGS fastmath, arch=native | 0.737 seconds | 1.75x | 1259x |
| LVL8. HARD CODED AVX2 INTRINSICS | 0.69 seconds | 1.07x | 1345x |

ALL THE KERNELS ARE IN matMulCPU.h header file.


THE FIRST 2 KERNELS WERE COMPILED WITH MSVC.


I DID THIS AS HOBBBY PROJECT SO THE CODE LACKS PROPER BENCHMARKING. 


THE CODE IS HEAVILY INSPIRED FROM <b>Charles Leiserson's</b> LECTURE ON MITOCW PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING. 


ANY NEW BENCHMARKS/IMPROVEMENTS ARE WELCOME.
